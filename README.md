# Employee-Tracker

## Description
In this assignment I needed to build a command-line application to be able to manage a company's employeee database. In the command-line we needed to have multiple option for the user to choose from. options were, view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee. Using my seed.sql file I was able to make departments values, role values with salary, and department id, and employees with a first and last name with their role id number. So when we first run the application they will be charts with existing data. Following came the option to add to our database without using the seed.sql file. That was done in the server.js where I used functions to be able to add a new employee with their department and their new role. Once that is completed you can see the new employee being added to the chart with all our current employees. 




## Video 

For this assignment we had to create a walkthrough video that demonstrated our command-line application. I used the app Screencastify to create my video. Below you can watch the video.

## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push.

## Conclusion

This challenge was tougher than the previous ones but it's a great way to show off our newly learned skills to be able to build a command-line application. This took time with a lot of thinking but I'm happy I was able to complete the assignment!
